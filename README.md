# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm M1u1N

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This README is a ready-to-use template that includes an embedded **Moe Counter** using the **`rule34`** theme.

> **Important:** The counter is now set to use the name `M1u1N-visitor`.

### Visitor counter (Moe Counter â€” `rule34` theme)

Add this line where you want the badge to appear in your README (GitHub supports raw HTML in README files):

```html
<!-- Moe Counter (rule34 theme) - using `M1u1N-visitor` -->
<img src="https://count.getloli.com/@M1u1N-visitor?theme=rule34&padding=7&align=center&pixelated=1&darkmode=auto" alt="visitor counter" loading="lazy" />
```

If you prefer Markdown image syntax (works in most places but offers less control over attributes):

```md
![visitors](https://count.getloli.com/@M1u1N-visitor?theme=rule34&padding=7&align=center&pixelated=1&darkmode=auto)
```

## GitHub Stats (optional)

You can add GitHub stat cards from common services (example placeholders):

```md
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=your-github-username&layout=compact)
![Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=your-github-username&show_icons=true)
```

## How to use this as your GitHub profile README

1. Create a **new repository** with the **exact same name as your GitHub username** (for example, if your username is `octocat`, create a repo named `octocat`).
2. Add a `README.md` to that repository and paste the contents of this template (replace `your-github-username`, and other placeholders).
3. Commit and push. Your GitHub profile page will render the README automatically.

---

## Notes & Privacy

* The demo hosted counter at `count.getloli.com` is a public/shared service. If you care about privacy or stability, consider self-hosting the Moe Counter (see the projectâ€™s GitHub repo) or use a privacy-friendly analytics alternative.
* The `rule34` theme is just a theme name offered by the counter service. The badge is an image served from that service and does not itself host or display explicit content within the README â€” it is a themed badge image.

## Want it customized?

Tell me the values you want replaced (your display name, short bio, GitHub username for stats) and Iâ€™ll create a pre-filled README ready for you to copy.
